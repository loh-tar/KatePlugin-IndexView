Test And Demo File For The PlainText-Parser
=============================================
With this plugin you have something like a table of contents when reading/edit a
plain text file like a README.


Section
=========
Recognized right now is only === as section and --- as header starting at a
length of 3 characters, all other text is treated as paragraph.



There can be any space before or after some recognized section/header/paragraph
which must not affect the desired result.




Header
--------



So this is a paragraph consist only of one line.

 - This paragraph has
 - two lines

This is a new paragraph
with a length
of three lines.

There is no length compare done to test if the underlining fit the title length.
I had though about to add these check in a way that it is somehow fuzzy, because
my style is to add to more underlining characters, others prefer to fill a
complete line or 70%, 80% of a full line.

The decision to use a min length of three fit to all these but of cause no
shorter headers, because that looks to me rather unlikely.
Don't wonder the "1 (with underline -)" is not shown, see "Special Treatments"
below.

For my taste works this all pretty charming when you have a well formatted file.
It works so nicely that also a bad styled formatting is treated correctly.

Bad Formatting Example
========================
Missed Empty Line
-------------------
Foo bar text

^-- Well done as Section/Header/Paragraph


But there could be things improved. As hint what I talk about I have
inserted below some example lines.


Special Treatments
====================

Avoided Paragraphs
--------------------
To keep the symbol list free from useless entries, will some lines ignored. So
none of the following must treated as start of a new paragraph.

A single line of section/header characters...

---
===

...any line consists of only one character...

x
y
#
?
!

...and any line with only two characters if there are as follows:

--
##
**
..
//

The sharp is obviously useful in some config file, the others I have added
without an concrete example, just only by a gut feeling.


ISO-Date Forced Sections
--------------------------
I have the habit to write down some notes like a diary, starting with a ISO
date, sometimes underlined the date, sometimes not. So I added a special check
that these ISO dates are treated as if written like so...

=================================================

...but my entries looks this way:

2018-07-19
============
Made first commit of my Kate patches to the symbol view plugin

 - Fix broken toggle actions
 - Avoid unneeded update of current item
 - Add a plain-text-parser
 - Fix: Find new current item when symbol is in first line

2018-07-22
    Contacted the "Kate-Devils" at there list
    Nice people, but a bit taciturn

2018-07-25
============
Very cool, my first patch is upstream
That was lastly faster than thought


Without this trick would only be the date appears in the symbol list, which is
not a sufficient information for my taste, and in one case not a section
created. What sadly not work is when an empty line is between the date and the
next paragraph.

The former could be added but I'm not sure if that may cause unexpected results,
because there are only three consecutive lines compared. So, no check can by
made if above the date is the line empty. To catch the ladder there would be make
a check of five lines or some other special quirk.


Other Seen Structuring Styles
-------------------------------
I can remember that I have seen plain text files where was other characters used
as underlining to indicate a section or header, e.g.

Using Sharp
###########

Using Tilde
~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Asterisk
**************

Using Caret
^^^^^^^^^^^

I have quickly added these as you can see, but in a (too?) very lazy way:

Feel Free
#*=#*=#*=

To Fix Me
-^-~-^-~-

Perhaps not a problem but a funny feature.


Room For Improvements
=======================
There could be a list with items indented to the paragraph. But that's not only
an issue of parsing, There are not enough menu options to control these. But,
perhaps may this not a real problem.
